## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core WireGuard Integration (Days 1-2)
1. Enhanced key management and persistence
2. Basic tunnel establishment between gateway and tunnel
3. Peer configuration management

### Phase 2: Dynamic Peer Management (Days 3-4)
1. Tunnel registration API
2. Peer addition/removal workflows
3. IP allocation system

### Phase 3: Network Management (Days 5-6)
1. Route propagation
2. Subnet management
3. Connection monitoring

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Day 7)
1. Integration tests for WireGuard functionality
2. Performance benchmarks
3. Security validation

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Functional WireGuard Tunnels**: Gateway and tunnel can establish encrypted connections
‚úÖ **Dynamic Peer Management**: Tunnels can register and deregister dynamically
‚úÖ **Automatic IP Allocation**: New peers receive IP addresses automatically
‚úÖ **Health Monitoring**: Connection status is monitored and reported
‚úÖ **Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite validates all functionality

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Enhanced WireGuard Managers**: Improved gateway and tunnel WireGuard implementations
2. **Peer Registration System**: API endpoints and workflows for peer management
3. **IP Allocation Service**: Dynamic IP assignment for tunnel clients
4. **Monitoring & Health Checks**: Connection status and performance monitoring
5. **WireGuard Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test suite for tunnel functionality
6. **Documentation**: API documentation and deployment guides

## Risk Mitigation

- **Network Interface Permissions**: Graceful handling of platforms without interface creation privileges
- **Port Conflicts**: Dynamic port assignment and conflict resolution
- **Key Security**: Secure key storage and transmission
- **Connection Reliability**: Robust error handling and reconnection logic

## Next Week Preview

Week 3 will focus on production deployment, performance optimization, and scalability improvements building on the WireGuard foundation established in Week 2.
